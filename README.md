# Machine-Learning-A-Probabilistic-Perspective-Solutions

Hey there. I am recording the solutions of the exercises of the fourth printing of this book in this repository. The only exceptions are those which explicit require MATLAB. Any computational exercise will be done in Python when possible. I will follow a schema where I give a brief introduction to the problem, solve it and then make some remarks on the solution. I intend to update the solutions every week, start from now (January 2016).

I hope this can help anyone who has an interest in the book and Machine Learning as a whole. If you have any question, want to debate about the book or think that some solution may be wrong, feel free to send me an e-mail at: arthurzc23@gmail.com.
