# Machine-Learning-A-Probabilistic-Perspective-Solutions

Hey there. I am recording the solutions of the exercises of the fourth printing of this book in this repository. The only exercises that I do not intend to do in this first run are those which explicit require MATLAB. Any computational exercise will be done in Python when possible. I will follow a schema where I give a introduction and some insight into the problem, solve it and then make some remarks on the solution. I intend to update the solutions in a reasonable pace, starting now (January 2016). 

I hope this can help anyone who has an interest in the book and Machine Learning as a whole. If you have any question, want to debate about the book, think that some solution may be wrong or could be complemented, feel free to send me an e-mail at: arthurzc23@gmail.com.
