# Machine-Learning-A-Probabilistic-Perspective-Solutions

## Motivation

Hey there. I am recording the solutions of the exercises of the fourth printing of this book in this repository. The only exercises that I do not intend to do in this first run are those which explicit require MATLAB. Any computational exercise will be done in Python when possible. I will follow a schema where I give a introduction and some insight into the problem, solve it and then make some remarks on the solution. I strongly reccomend the reading of the Intro and Conclusion section of the exercises that you're interested in. I intend to update the solutions in a reasonable pace, starting now (January 2016). 

I hope this might help anyone who has an interest in the book and Machine Learning as a whole. If you have any question, want to debate about the book, or think that some solution may be wrong or could be improved, feel free to send me an e-mail at: arthurzc23@gmail.com.

## Updates

03/01/2017: Just came back from Carnaval today. I will post the solutions to 3.7 - 3.11 until Sunday

## About the author

I am a brazilian Electrical Engineer graduated at Unicamp, one the most prestigious universities in my country.
I graduated as the best student of my class in 2016, among other honors. Currently, I am a M.S. student on the Electrical Engineering program at the same University, where I intend to use machine learning in agriculture problems. I am interested in a summer 
intership in Canada, on any startup/company working with machine learning. If you want to know more about me, feel free to contact me.
