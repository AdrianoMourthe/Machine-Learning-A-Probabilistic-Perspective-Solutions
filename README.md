# Machine-Learning-A-Probabilistic-Perspective-Solutions

Hey there. I am recording all the solutions to the exercises of this book in this repository. The only exceptions are those which explicit require MATLAB. Any computational exercise will be done in Python when possible. I hope this can help anyone who has an interest in the book. If you have any question or think that some solution may be wrong, feel free to send me an e-mail at: arthurzc23@gmail.com.
